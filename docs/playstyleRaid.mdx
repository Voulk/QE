# How to Play - Raid

So, we’ve learned a little bit about our spells, but perhaps more importantly we must learn when to cast what. This can sometimes be encounter specific so think of these as general strategies that can work well in a wide variety of situations.

## Raid Healing Strategy
To raid heal as a Resto Druid you will learn to **anticipate damage**. This can be a very rewarding play style as you’ll find your numbers going steadily up as you learn how best to heal each boss. It can be easy as a new player to react to damage going out by casting Rejuvenations on damaged players which is acceptable but not optimal. Make sure you read the ramps section further down the page after you’ve finished this brief summary. Most of your HPS will come from combining your buttons.
- Keep Efflorescence on a stack of at least three allies likely to take damage. You can often line up both the tank and melee group to guarantee full value. Aim for 100% uptime.
- Keep Lifebloom on yourself for Photosynthesis value. Aim for 100% uptime. Losing uptime here is a significant healing loss.
- Cast [Wild Growth](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=48438/wild-growth) on cooldown if six or more allies have taken damage. You shouldn’t cast Wild Growth before the damage hits as the first few ticks of the HoT are the largest and shouldn’t be wasted. Wild Growth is very efficient, and should be cast as often as possible. Pair it with Swiftmend for Soul of the Forest value.
- Cast Rejuvenation on any allies that are about to take damage, or that have taken significant damage. You’ll get into the habit of chain-casting a bunch of Rejuvs before major raid damage goes out – with the Luxuriant Soil talent you can begin doing this quite far before raid damage hits. We’ll discuss this further below in the “ramps” section.
- Cast Grove Guardians throughout the fight. Your timing here isn’t too important and you’re fine to just send one or more whenever the raid is taking a decent amount of damage. Your key goals are to avoid overcapping your charges. Grove Guardians are not on the global cooldown which means you can and should cast them at the same time as another spell.
- Use Regrowth and Swiftmend to keep low HP people from dying. Prioritize targets with already existing HoTs for a larger emergency heal. If you are running Abundance you will cast Regrowth a lot after you hit Flourish or whenever you have a ton of Rejuvenations out.

:::tip
Always remember: Your job is to keep people alive, and you should throw everything into making sure that’s the case. Saving people who made a mistake can greatly speed up your progression.

### What to do with downtime

Let's discover **Docusaurus in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site right now

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
