# Hero Talents: An Intro

The War Within adds two *Hero Trees* for Mistweaver: <HeroTreeHeader heroTree="Conduit of the Celestials"/> and <HeroTreeHeader heroTree="Master of Harmony"/>. Unfortunately, <HeroTreeHeader heroTree="Master of Harmony" showImage={false} /> is currently tuned very poorly and it is very buggy/boring to play with so I will not really be talking about it since it’s just not competitive at all in raid. <HeroTreeHeader heroTree="Conduit of the Celestials" showImage={false} /> is going to be our premier hero talent choice. I will give a short introduction to each of the notable talents and how to play around with them in raid.


<FloatingImage title="Celestial Conduit" paragraph="The Keystone ability is CelestialConduit which is a very strong AoE heal/damage pulsing 90 second cooldown that does not have much synergy with the rest of the kit but does provide a lot of HPS for a 90 second cooldown. I recommend pairing Celestial Conduit with Shaohao's Lessons if you have it talented or with your Secret Infusion buff to maximize the amount of HPS it does in the short window. It is a channeled spell similar to how Essence Font functioned in the past. You can move with it but you can also cancel it with other effects so be wary of accidentally canceling early." image={require("./images/Celestial-Conduit.jpg").default} />

&nbsp;

<FloatingImage title="Courage of the White Tiger / Strength of the Black Ox" paragraph="Courage of the White Tiger and Strength of the Black Ox is where a majority of the power of CotC (Conduit of the Celestials) comes from. Courage passively procs as you do your normal rotation so we will be focusing on Strength of the Black Ox since it’ll impact our rotation. Strength of the Black Ox allows for your <WH>Enveloping Mist</WH> to be cast 50% quicker and grants small absorb shields to nearby allies based on your maximum HP. Due to Courage randomly proccing throughout a fight we will be weaving these reduced Enveloping Mist casts into our rotation. We’ll talk about that more in the Rotation section further down the page." image={require("./images/Courage-of-the-White-Tiger.jpg").default} />

&nbsp;

<FloatingImage title="Flight of the Red Crane" paragraph="Flight of the Red Crane is a passive small heal that exists to grant a stack of Mana Tea and to give us a 2% haste buff with Inner Compass. It really is not that impactful but is a nice small increase." image={require("./images/Flight-of-the-Red-Crane.jpg").default} />

&nbsp;

<FloatingImage title="Heart of the Jade Serpent" paragraph="Heart of the Jade Serpent gives us cooldown reduction on a number of abilities based on the amount of clouds consumed per each cast of Sheilun's Gift. It’s 0.8 seconds per cloud with Shaohao’s Lessons and 0.4 seconds per cloud with Veil of Pride.  This buff is relatively low impact compared to some of the others but it does get amplified by the next talent which makes it something you want to play around." image={require("./images/Heart-of-the-Jade-Serpent.jpg").default} />

&nbsp;

<FloatingImage title="Unity Within" paragraph="Pairing with Celestial Conduit, Unity Within grants you all 4 aforementioned talents’ effects at 200% effectiveness. Currently, this does not grant additional stacks of Mana Tea from Flight of the Red Crane but it does increase the CDR from Heart enough to make it something we want to play around. Explained more in the Rotation section of the guide." image={require("./images/Unity-Within.jpg").default} />

&nbsp;

<FloatingImage title="Inner Compass" paragraph="Inner Compass grants a stat buff according to whichever celestial last helped you. It does not grant all 4 buffs during your Celestial Conduit window. Unity Within ignores Inner Compass entirely." image={require("./images/Inner-Compass.jpg").default} />
