# Aspect of Harmony

![<WH>Aspect of Harmony</WH>](..\images\moh\AspectofHarmony.png)

## Vitality

As you heal or deal damage, 30% of your healing and 10% of your damage‚Äîor 40% with Way of a <WH>Way of a Thousand Strikes</WH>‚Äîis stored as Vitality.

:::info[NOTE]
This doesn‚Äôt reduce your healing or damage output‚Äîyou still deal 100% of your normal throughput.
:::

Simply put, **Vitality** is a resource that needs to be tracked, showing both how much you‚Äôve accumulated (capped at your max HP) and how long you have before the withdrawal period ends.


Activating <WH>Thunder Focus Tea</WH> triggers <WH>Aspect of Harmony Withdraw</WH>, a 10-second window where you tap into your stored Vitality to enhance healing or damage by applying and strengthening <WH short="HoT">Aspect of Harmony HoT</WH>s and <WH short="DoT">Aspect of Harmony DoT</WH>s.

At the end of this withdrawal period, any remaining Vitality is handled differently depending on your talents:

- <WH>Purified Spirit</WH> ‚Äì Any leftover Vitality is released as an 8-second HoT (<WH>Purified Spirit</WH>), evenly distributed among nearby allies. This HoT does not benefit from <WH>Coalescence</WH>.
- <WH>Harmonic Gambit</WH> ‚Äì Any unused Vitality simply disappears. GG. üôÅ

To maximize effectiveness, the goal is to spend your entire Vitality pool before <WH>Aspect of Harmony Withdraw</WH> ends, ensuring targets receive full <WH short="HoT">Aspect of Harmony HoT</WH>/<WH short="DoT">Aspect of Harmony DoT</WH> benefits and allowing you to continue healing or dealing damage for even greater impact within the <HeroTreeHeader heroTree="Master of Harmony"/> hero tree.

### WeakAuras

I strongly suggest using a WeakAura to track your vitality:
