import ITEM from "../../src/components/ItemLink"

- Make sure you are using <WH>Thunder Focus Tea</WH> as close to on cooldown as possible WHILE your vitality is capped. Having two charges of <WH>Thunder Focus Tea</WH> gives a lot of room for you to fill that vitality to the max while a second charge is recharging.

- Watch your <WH>Clarity of Purpose</WH> stacks! Having 10 stacks is a guaranteed way that your next <WH>Vivify</WH> will fill up your vitality faster than (almost) anything else!

- Since storing vitality from overhealing is reduced, try to use <WH>Vivify</WH> only on injured targets that can benefit from it to store more into your reservoir if you’re trying to max it out.

- The cap of vitality moves dynamically with your max health increasing - anything that increases it will allow you to pool more into your vitality. <WH>Jadefire Teachings</WH> and <WH>Fortifying Brew</WH> are the easiest ways to raise your max HP alongside external sources such as <WH>Rallying Cry</WH> or <ITEM>Cyrce's Circlet</ITEM>'s <ITEM>Seabed Leviathan's Citrine</ITEM> proccing.

- Try to expel your vitality completely before using high-damaging abilities like <WH>Crackling Jade Lightning</WH> since you run the risk of transferring some of your intended damage into healing by intensifying existing <WH>Aspect of Harmony HoT</WH>s. 

- You can <WH>Thunder Focus Tea</WH> -> <WH>Crackling Jade Lightning</WH>, but that will never apply the <WH>Aspect of Harmony DoT</WH> as its not listed under <WH>Harmonic Gambit</WH>.

- Save multiple charges of <WH>Thunder Focus Tea</WH> and <WH>Crackling Jade Lightning</WH> in very hard trash packs so you can make use of <WH>Crackling Jade Lightning</WH> back to back to back to back with very high healing output.

- <WH>Spinning Crane Kick</WH> is a great way to intensify <WH>Aspect of Harmony DoT</WH>s quickly on multiple targets since each “spin” has multiple hits which = more chances to intensify. Since intensify doesn’t refresh the <WH short="DoT">Aspect of Harmony DoT</WH> and only adds vitality to it, I would still recommend against using <WH>Spinning Crane Kick</WH> for damage and healing at its current tuning.
