#### My vitality isn’t full, and I have no cooldowns left, but I have <WH>Thunder Focus Tea</WH> charges for an incoming damage phase. Should I use it?
> Yes! Use <WH>Thunder Focus Tea</WH> as you normally would, gain a <WH>Jade Empowerment</WH> charge, and keep healing your group regardless of vitality.

#### What do I spend <WH>Thunder Focus Tea</WH> on?
> Reference the [Raid 11.1 FAQ](../11.1-FAQ#thunder-focus-tea) or the [Mythic+ Playstyle Shifts](playstyle#thunder-focus-tea-usage-1) sections of the respective Mistweaver guides.

####  Should I tab target mobs to apply <WH>Aspect of Harmony DoT</WH>?
> No need! <WH>Blackout Kick</WH> should distribute the DoT fairly evenly among a pack of mobs.

####  Does <WH>Aspect of Harmony DoT</WH> damage convert into <WH>Ancient Teachings</WH> healing?
> No, the DoT is categorized as "<WH short="Aspect of Harmony">Aspect of Harmony DoT</WH>" which is not included under the damaging spells and abilities <WH>Ancient Teachings</WH> uses to convert into healing.

####  Does Overwhelming Force damage convert into <WH>Ancient Teachings</WH> healing?
> No, it is categorized as "<WH>Overwhelming Force</WH>" which is not included under the damaging spells and abilities <WH>Ancient Teachings</WH> uses to convert into healing.

####  Does <WH>Ancient Teachings</WH> double dip with <WH>Coalescence</WH>, increasing both damage and healing?
> No, unfortunately not. While <WH short="DoT">Aspect of Harmony DoT</WH> does boost your damage, that extra damage isn’t factored into <WH>Ancient Teachings</WH> healing. Additionally, if an <WH>Ancient Teachings</WH> heal heals someone with the <WH short="HoT">Aspect of Harmony HoT</WH>, they won't receive extra healing from it. This is likely a bug on the healing amp side. You can read a bit more about the amp quirks [here](./coalescence.md#quirk).

####  Should my <WH>Aspect of Harmony HoT</WH> appear as low healing on my logs?
> In raids, no—it should be one of your highest HPS entries. In Mythic+, yes, lower healing values are expected—around 1-3% HPS depending on the dungeon.

####  What’s the deal with <WH>Balanced Stratagem</WH>?
> Don’t stress over <WH>Balanced Stratagem</WH>—treat it as a passive bonus. In most situations where it could be optimized, you won’t have the freedom to hold globals or alter your rotation to buff a specific spell. I personally don't track it in any capacity.
