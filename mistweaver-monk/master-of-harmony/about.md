## Author Note

Hi, I'm Swirl. :) Since the mid-Season 1 buff to <HeroTreeHeader heroTree="Master of Harmony"/>, the tree has gained an absolute ton of attention. With its somewhat mysterious mechanics sparking plenty of speculation and questions, I’ve put together this guide to help clear things up!

#### TLDR:
> Press spells → gain resource.  
> Press Thunder Focus Tea → begin spending resource by pressing more spells.  
> Press even more spells after resource is fully spent → deal extra healing and damage.  
> Repeat!

## About Master of Harmony

<HeroTreeHeader heroTree="Master of Harmony"/> is a hero tree centered around <WH>Aspect of Harmony</WH>, where you generate and spend a new resource called **Vitality** to enhance your healing—or damage if you talent into <WH>Harmonic Gambit</WH>—bolstering the rest of your abilities.

You accumulate Vitality as a portion of all healing and damage you deal, up to a cap equal to your maximum health.

Expelling this Vitality happens when you activate <WH>Thunder Focus Tea</WH>, transforming you into the <WH>Aspect of Harmony</WH>. In this state, you withdraw portions of your reservoir to apply an <WH>Aspect of Harmony HoT</WH> through healing or an <WH>Aspect of Harmony DoT</WH> through damage.

The strength of these effects scales with the spell used to apply them—40% of the spell’s power is converted into the total strength of the over-time effect.

<WH>Coalescence</WH> further amplifies this by increasing the healing or damage targets receive, spreading the effect to nearby allies or enemies, and intensifying its potency.

The core gameplay loop of <HeroTreeHeader heroTree="Master of Harmony" showImage={false}/> revolves around applying the <WH short="HoT">Aspect of Harmony HoT</WH>/<WH short="DoT">Aspect of Harmony DoT</WH> and continuing to heal or deal damage to affected targets, maximizing your throughput. Don’t worry—we’ll break this down further.
