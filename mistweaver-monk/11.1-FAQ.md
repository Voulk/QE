# An Intro to 11.1

## What's changing going into 11.1
There weren't too many changes for Mistweaver Monk in 11.1 in terms of playstyle. Instead we'll cover all changes from the start of the expansion to make it easier to jump back in for returning players:


- Rushing Wind Kick was added as a choice node with Jadefire Teachings. It replaces Rising Sun Kick as a ranged alternative and also buffs your Renewing Mists for a short period of time. 
- Jade Bond was changed to remove the variable cooldown reduction entirely and instead provide a substantial benefit to your Chi Cocoons created from summoning your Celestial. It also gives each Chi Cocoon a 4 second Enveloping Mist when removed. 
- The cooldown of both Celestials is now 2 minutes.
- Jade Empowerment and Dance of Chi-Ji were added to offer more DPS options in the tree. 
- Sheilun’s Gift was moved further up the tree and a ST choice node talent was added to be shared with Legacy of Wisdom.
- Ancient Teachings is now a baseline passive at 30% effectiveness, increased to 190% when talented into Jadefire Teachings. 
- A bug with Misty Peaks/Mana Tea channel casting was fixed.
- Mana Tea was nerfed by 15% .
- Chi-Ji was nerfed by around 32% which hurt that playstyle significantly.

## 11.1 Tier Set
All healers in patch 11.1 were given a very similar tier set. Each of them have the Insurance mechanic and play around it in a different way. Mistweaver’s tier set is no different and it provides a substantial amount of additional healing just by playing your rotation normally. We'll make a few minor changes to our playstyle to get even more value. First, let's take a look at it:

- **2pc**: Gives our healing spells a chance to apply a strong HoT called Insurance! It ticks every 3 seconds (modified by haste) and lasts for 15 seconds. If the target drops low they'll get a big instant heal and the HoT will disappear. You can expect 5 + haste procs per minute - before extras.
- **4pc**: Renewing Mist now applies Insurance for 6 seconds too! This works with Rapid Diffusion which is a large part of why the tier set is so strong for us. The amount of healing Insurance does is also increased by up to 50% based on the number of Renewing Mists you have on your group. This value scales with party size so if you're in a group of 5 then 5 renewing mists will give you the full 50% increase whereas if you're in a raid of 10 people you'd need 10.

Insurance makes up enough of our healing that it's worth playing around to maximize its value.

## Gameplay Changes in 11.1

### Thunder Focus Tea

Previously we only used Thunder Focus Tea on Renewing Mists in raid because haste is an extremely good stat for us. That part is still true but Zen Pulse doesn't have any haste scaling which means we'll sometimes want to prioritize a different buff.
- Enveloping Mist: Using Thunder Focus Tea on Enveloping Mist requires some understanding. Due to Zen Pulse not scaling with haste it can be beneficial to get Crit instead to buff this window. If you have a high Renewing Mist count and either already have a Zen Pulse proc or know that the proc you'll get from Thunder Focus Tea is going to generate a lot of healing with little overhealing then you can use your proc on Enveloping Mist. Use this as you would a normal Strength of the Black Ox Enveloping Mist, find a target who'll need the HoT and apply it. Try not to overlap procs if you can.
- Expel Harm: A niche choice but you can unse it as a pseudo defensive if the time comes where you'd want to simultaneously press Thunder Focus Tea and Expel Harm. Keep in mind that Jade Bond also buffs the CHi Cocoon generated by TFT -> Expel Harm by 100% which can make it a decent option for HPS at times.

**Do I have to do this? Can't I just use it on Renewing Mists still?**
This is a min-max tactic only and you can absolutely continue to use it on Renewing Mist for only a minor loss.

**Important Note**
You **must** continue to use Thunder Focus Tea on Renewing Mist directrly before or during your Celestial window. Getting any other stat during your Celestial is a massive HPS loss during key moments in the fight.
