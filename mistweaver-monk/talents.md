# Talents

Many talents have been changed slightly or reworked entirely coming into The War Within. We'll take a look at some of those, but first let's check out which build we'll be running.

![Monk Raid Talents](.\images\MonkBuildRaid111.png)

**Import Link:** C4QACdq2zyOHcHaPcZ/HhhelgDAAAAAAAADLMzywGmxMzywG2mZ2sNLbbzMLLMjmZmBmhZwwsNjZY2YMDLmAAAAAMLTbzyMLzilZZZ2mZmgAAbA

#### Alternative Builds
##### Sheilun's Gift and Shaohao's Lessons 

This build takes both Sheilun's Gift and <WH>Shaohao's Lessons</WH> and opts to take out a point in <WH>Misty Peaks</WH>. This build is our strongest build for maximizing HPS currently because Shaohao's has significant value inside our Celestial window. You want to use Sheilun's Gift to amplify your cooldowns as much as possible. Try to use Sheilun's Gift before Yu'lon with Lesson of Fear (haste) or with Lesson of Despair (crit). You can also use Sheilun's Gift to buff your Zen Pulse windows if you recognize you are going to get significant value from that. I recommend using this build on basically every fight where you are looking to maximize your HPS:
    - **Import Link:** C4QACdq2zyOHcHaPcZ/HhhelgDAAAAAAAADLMzywGmxMWG2sNbzMsNLbbzMLLMjmZmBmhZwwsNjZY2YMDLmAAAAAMLTLzyMLzilZZZ2mZmgAAbA 

##### DPS Focused Build

This build takes <WH>Jade Empowerment</WH> without taking Jadefire Teachings instead of taking Mending Proliferation. This build will see a good amount of play for those who are wishing to maximize their DPS contribution in progression raiding. You are sacrificing ~4% HPS by dropping Mending Proliferation in order to get 30% more DPS from Crackling Jade Lightning. I recommend this build on fights where you do not need that much HPS and DPS matters more. 
- **Import Link:** C4QACdq2zyOHcHaPcZ/HhhelgDAAAAAAAAjZhZgN2mxMzyDwmtZbmhtZZbbmZZhZ0MzMwMMDGsNjZY2YmZYxEAAAAgZZaZWmZZWsMLLz2MzEEAYD

#### Single Target Sheilun’s Gift 

This build also utilizes <WH>Sheilun's Gift</WH> but opts for the new talent added this patch called Emperor’s Favor. It makes Sheilun’s Gift do 150% increased healing and have no cast time but now it only hits a single target. This talent can be very good on fights with heavy amounts of priority target healing that needs to be done. For example: Queensbane on Nexus Princess. 
    - **Import Link:** C4QACdq2zyOHcHaPcZ/HhhelgDAAAAAAAADLWmhxGmxMWeA22WmtZG2mlttZmlFmRzMzAzwMYw2MmhZbMmhFTAAAAAmlptZZmlZxyssMbzMTQAgNA

#### Five Target Sheilun's Gift

Similar to the previous build but with Legacy of Wisdom instead of Emperor’s Favor. This talent setup is good for fights with similar damage patterns mentioned in the first Sheilun’s Gift talent build. If you can guarantee low overhealing this talent setup can provide a significant amount of healing to 5 targets at a time. 
    - **Import Link:** C4QACdq2zyOHcHaPcZ/HhhelgDAAAAAAAADLWmhxGmxMWeA2WWmtZG2mlttZmlFmRzMzAzwMYw2MmhZbMmhFTAAAAAmlptZZmlZxyssMbzMTQAgNA

#### Jade Empowerment and Jadefire Teachings

This build focuses on <WH>Ancient Teachings</WH> healing by pairing your buff window with <WH>Jade Empowerment</WH> to mix both damage and healing into the same window. It is important to note that when playing with this build your <WH>Thunder Focus Tea</WH> casts should be on RSK or <WH>Enveloping Mist</WH> exclusively unless you are in your Yu’lon window. You would treat your Crackling Jade Lightning cast as a legitimate healing cooldown with a 30 second CD. This build is good for fights with add cleave. 
    - **Import Link:** C4QACdq2zyOHcHaPcZ/HhhelgDAAAAAAAADLWmhxCbzYmZZYDbzMsNLbbzMLLMjmZmBmhZwgtZMDz2YMDLmAAAAAMLTbzyMLzilZZZ2mZmgAAbA

#### Chi-Ji and Jadefire Stomp 

The bones of this build are good and it has a lot of potential - even more than initially anticipated. You'll play around <WH>Jade Empowerment</WH> and <WH>Chi-ji</WH> windows with an emphasis on Haste / Crit and consistent DPS uptime. <WH>Chi-ji</WH> was nerfed quite heavily going into 11.1 so I'd only recommend it for fights with add cleave or if you need more DPS.
    - **Import Link:** C4QACdq2zyOHcHaPcZ/HhhelgDAAAAAAAADbMzyYWMbzYGLYz2sNzgZbbbmZZhZ0MzMwMMDGsNjZY2GjZYxEAAAAgZZabWmZZWsMLLz2MzEEAYD


### Common Talent Swaps

- **Full Melee Builds**: Definitely an option for normal or heroic raiding but it will not be competitive with the casting focused Yu’lon builds. 
- **<WH>Yu'lon's Whisper</WH>**: Received a number of buffs and is a viable alternative now. Just don't combine it with <WH>Energizing Brew</WH>.
- **<WH>Uplifted Spirits</WH>**: Should be taken if you need the CDR on your <WH>Revival</WH>. Drop Yu’lon’s Whisper for it. 
- **<WH>Healing Elixir</WH>:** If you feel it's needed for survival in a fight then exchange Yu’lon’s Whisper for it. 
- **<WH>Lifecycles</WH> / <WH>Energizing Brew</WH>**: The math always supports <WH>Lifecycles</WH> being the better choice but if you do not need mana and want the faster drink time then play with <WH>Energizing Brew</WH>. 
- **<WH>Gift of the Celestials</WH>**: Not currently viable in raid. It is just numerically weaker all around compared to <WH>Jade Bond</WH>. 
- **<WH>Lotus Infusion</WH>**: Extremely weak compared to <WH>Chi Harmony</WH> because <WH>Chi Harmony</WH> buffs the tierset more than <WH>Lotus Infusion</WH> can. Should not be taken in 11.1
- **<WH>Tear of Morning</WH>**: Essentially dead on arrival this tier. Our tier set scales with the amount of <WH>Renewing Mist</WH>s out so <WH>Tear of Morning</WH> falls behind significantly and it was already struggling prior.
- **<WH>Peer into Peace</WH>**: Not really worth trying to make work in raid, just focus on playing with Pool of Mists. 

## More Talent Information

<FloatingImage title="Zen Pulse" paragraph="Zen Pulse has been reworked from an active button to a passive effect that amplifies the healing that your Vivify and Invigorating Mists cleave does which is increased by the number of Renewing Mist you currently have active when pressing Vivify. Zen Pulse can stack up twice and it helps fix the square root scaling issue that Invigorating Mists has. The proc rate of this talent is extremely low on its own however, you can forcibly proc it using Thunder Focus Tea because of Deep Clarity. The Deep Clarity proc activates once you consume your Thunder Focus Tea buff." image={require("./images/ZenPulse.jpg").default} />

&nbsp;

<FloatingImage title="Chi Harmony" paragraph="Chi Harmony makes a return with a bit of a twist; it can no longer spread your Renewing Mist applied to the target for the duration of the Chi Harmony healing increase buff. This ends up being a blessing in disguise because it amplifies our spot healing by quite a bit. This talent shares a choice node with Lotus Infusion which is currently just weaker than Chi Harmony so it is not played." image={require("./images/ChiHarmony.jpg").default} />

&nbsp;

<FloatingImage title="Pool of Mists" paragraph="Pool of Mists makes a return from Warlords of Draenor. This talent helps to solve issues with RSK not resetting for Rising Mists making it a bit more consistent as well as adding more average Renewing Mist out through the CDR and the extra charge. It is a solid talent choice that took the spot of Clouded Focus on the choice node with Peer into Peace." image={require("./images/PoolOfMists.jpg").default} />

&nbsp;

<FloatingImage title="Mending Proliferation" paragraph="Previously an unused talent has suddenly become very good due to a number of factors. This will be expanded on when talking about our tierset later." image={require("./images/MendingProliferation.jpg").default} />

&nbsp;

<FloatingImage title="Rising Mist" paragraph="Welcome back the Lebron James of Mistweaver talents." image={require("./images/RisingMist.jpg").default} />

&nbsp;

<FloatingImage title="Rushing Wind Kick" paragraph="Rushing Wind Kick is a new talent that was added in 11.0.5 which replaces Rising Sun Kick with a ranged alternative that does significantly more damage and provides a buff to your Renewing Mist which increases the healing it does by 150% for 4 seconds. This talent interacts with all things that Rising Sun Kick would interact with and it will proc Rising Mists and Rapid Diffusion whether you hit a target or not." image={require("./images/Rushing-Wind-Kick.jpg").default} />
