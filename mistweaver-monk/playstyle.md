# How to Play - Raid

We're going to go through our rotation in subsections to make it easier to take in. Note that in modern day WoW the sections on how to best play your cooldowns are particularly important. This guide is very in depth so it can be worth reading through it, playing for a bit and then re-reading it.



### Rising Mist

![Rising Mist](.\images\RisingMist.jpg)

When Rising Mist is talented, Rising Sun Kick / Rushing Wind Kick becomes one of the highest priority abilities in the kit because they extend our Renewing Mist and our Enveloping Mist. A lot of our talents rely on these two abilities in order to do their healing which means that whenever Rising Sun Kick / Rushing Wind Kick is off cooldown you need to press it.


#### Cast Priority List
1. Vivify to keep someone alive who is in immediate danger and will die without your intervention
2. Revival / Restoral when it is needed or assigned
3. Renewing Mist if you are at 3 charges (2 without Pool of Mists)
4. Rising Sun Kick / Rushing Wind Kick
5. Thunder Focus Tea
6. Enveloping Mist with a Strength proc
7. Vivify when it makes sense to heal someone
8. Tiger Palm if you have nothing else going on


## Celestial Rotation
Here is an example of how your Yu'lon window should be played. We'll also run through some of the decisions being made and why.

![Monk Log Example](.\images\MonkLogExample.png)

### Vivify vs Enveloping Mist: When to cast each

Due to our new 4 set, Enveloping Mist gains an additional amount of spell power making it a stronger alternative to Vivify in basically every scenario during Yu'lon. Vivify is still stronger than a single cast of Enveloping Mist when you have Zen Pulse active. However, if you don't have a Zen Pulse proc, Vivify in most scenarios is going to result in a loss to your HPS. There are rare exceptions like when your raid has just taken significant damage and they need immediate healing before the next mechanic and you're aware that Enveloping Mist won't suffice.

### How many casts of Enveloping Mist should I have?

The answer depends on what kind of damage you're taking. If the raid is taking smaller damage over time and isn't on the brink of death then you can continue to spam Enveloping Mist. If the raid **is** on the brink of death then there's no specific number in mind. You cast based on the damage taken by the raid. The more damage they take, the more you cast. If you summon your celestial and don't feel the need to cast Enveloping Mist then you maybe mistimed your cooldown and should assign it elsewhere. In any case, look to get off as many casts as you can.

### Jade Bond
![Jade Bond](.\images\JadeBondTwo.png)

In 11.1 Jade Bond now incrases the shield size that your Chi Cocoons apply from summoning your Celestial. With Jade Bond, Chi Cocoons also apply a 4s Enveloping Mist when each Chi Cocoon is consumed. This is quite an important mechanic to play around and you should track Chi Cocoons on your raid frames to prevent any potential overlap with your manually cast Enveloping Mist. The Jade Bond Enveloping Mist don't proc Rapid Diffiusion but they can be extended by up to 4 seconds and they can spread Mending Proliferation. You'll naturally extend each of these with Rushing Wind Kick so don't worry too much about that portion. Just be smart with your casts of Rushing Wind Kick during your Celestial - especially after the first 2-3 casts of Enveloping Mist.

### Supplementary Spells & Zen Pulse

As seen in the log image above, you still want to prioritize Rushing Wind Kick whenever it's off cooldown. Renewing Mist is slightly more flexible and can be used if there's a short break in the damage taken or if you're approaching three Renewing Mist charges (avoid overcapping).

Zen Pulse is also quite a large portion of our HPS within our Celestial window so we want to make sure we get as much value out of it as we can. We use Thunder Focus Tea before our Yu'lon so we'll go into our ramp with a proc already banked. We want to apply as many Enveloping Mists as possible to get as many Renewing Mists out as we can to spread out healing increase leading up to the mechanic we want to use Vivify on. 

![Zen Pulse](.\images\ZenPulseExample.png)

This picture demonstrates how much Zen Pulse can contribute to you overall Yu'lon HPS, surpassing both Invigorating Mist and the Vivify direct heal.

> A common mistake a lot of Mistweavers make is that they unnecessarily spam Vivify following their first cast with Zen Pulse when they should instead go back to pressing Enveloping Mist. Another common mistake is to use Zen Pulse too *early* and to lose its value entirely.

## Maximizing your Gameplay

Once you have the basics down, there are some more in-depth mechanics that you can explore to improve your performance in raid.

### Chi Harmony

![Chi Harmony Example](.\images\ChiHarmonyExample.png)

Playing around Chi Harmony is crucial to maximizing your HPS. You want to be strategic with who you cast Renewing Mist on with Chi Harmony. Ideally your target will need immediate follow up healing instantly or within the next 6 seconds. In scenarios where you have your Black Ox proc up you can cast Enveloping Mist onto a priority target and then immediately follow it up with a Renewing Mist cast into the same target. These two spells will then tick very hard and you're likely free to move onto healing another target.

### Celestial Conduit

Celestial Conduit doesn't itself have much interaction to it but the buffs you receive from the Unity Within talent do and this could be a part of your gameplay that you're overlooking. Unity Within procs **all** of your Celestial buffs at 200% effectiveness. This means that immediately following your channel of Celestial Conduit, or if you recast during it, you'll receive a stronger version of Heart of the Jade Serpent. If you go into your Celestial Conduit having spent two of your Renewing Mist charges and Rushing Wind Kick then you can immediately recast Celestial Conduit to proc Unity Within. Following your channel, the cooldown reduction portion will have your Rushing Wind Kick and Renewing Mist back up immediately. You won't miss any uptime this way. As a general rule of thumb, try to keep Life Cocoon and Thunder Focus Tea on cooldown too before you active Celestial Conduit.

### Incorporating Mana Tea

Mana Tea has more complexity than most people initially think because it serves as a strong filler during downtime between your rotational abilities (Renewing Mist and Rushing Wind Kick). We want to be strategic with when we utilize it so we still have our mana restored while not losing any uptime overall. The majority of the time, I'll use Mana Tea while moving to places I need to be for the next mechanic. Remember you can move while channeling it and can utilize it in a similar way to instant cast spells. You'll also usually want to use Mana Tea at the same specific times pull to pull. Heres an example from Mythic Kyveza:

![Mana Tea Example](.\images\maximizingManaTea.png)

#### Mana Tea Example
<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', alignItems: 'flex-start' }}>
  <ReactPlayer

    playing 
    loop
    controls='false'
    style={{ paddingRight: "12px" }} 
  />
</div>



### Expel Harm

Expel Harm is hopefully self-explanatory. It does a significant amount of healing per cast and decent damage too. Whenever you're moving around and not casting Mana Tea, use Expel Harm if you're injured.

### Soothing Mist

Soothing Mist is a part of the kit that should be utilised in specific scenarios to increase your single target HPS. It is often overlooked because people don't understand when it should be used so here are two key scenarios:

**Faster Enveloping Mist casts**

![Soom Example](.\images\fasterEnveloping.png)

Here we can see the application time of Enveloping Mist. You'd use Soothing Mist -> Enveloping Mist in scenarios where you know you'll need a lot of single target healing on the target and you have the time to prepare an Enveloping Mist beforehand. By sequencing it this way your Enveloping Mist ticks sooner than it would have with a hard cast.

**Multiple Casts of Vivify**
The other scenario where Soothing Mist is commonly used is to cast multiple vivify into the same target sequentially. This is good for mechanics like Feast in phase 1 of Queen Ansurek where the tank takes a massive healing absorb that needs to be healed off.

### Chi Burst

Chi Burst is mostly used in stacked scenarios as a filler ability to replace a cast of Vivify. Don't cast it over a Rushing Wind Kick or Black Ox Enveloping Mist but it does ok outside of that and is completely free. A good time to use it might be the portals on Nexus Princess or Acid Spray on Rashanan.



## Stats

You can get pretty close to optimal by just strapping on your highest item level pieces with a lean toward Haste.

<div style={{ flex: '1', borderRadius: '8px', border: '2px  solid', borderColor: "goldenrod", backgroundColor: "#54460A", padding: '8px' }}>
    <h3>Raid Stat Priority</h3>
    <p>Intellect >> Haste > Crit > Versatility > Mastery</p>
</div>

&nbsp;

> Remember not to drop item level for secondaries. If you have a decent amount of haste then optimizing secondaries will do little for your performance.

### Rapidfire Questions

**Can I still play Tear of Morning and Soothing Mist?**
- Definitely, although I do recommend you try out Rising Mist to see if you really enjoy it or not. I won’t be writing a guide for how to play around with Tear of Morning or Soothing Mist without Clouded Focus but you’re welcome to ask questions on them if you have any.

**Is mastery good now?**
- It’s improved significantly but not to the point where you’ll stack it.

**Why is there not a section on Master of Harmony?**
- Master of Harmony is viable in Mythic+ but not in raid which this guide is focused on.

**Is Mistweaver good?**
- Yeah Mistweaver is near dominant if you are skilled at the spec.

**Any plans for an M+ guide?**
- Not at this time. [Megasett](https://www.youtube.com/c/Megasett) makes very good Mythic+ YouTube content.
