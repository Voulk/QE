# How to Play - Raid

We're going to go through our rotation in subsections to make it easier to take in but lets check out our tier set first:

- Renewing Mist and Enveloping Mist healing increased by 10%.
- Vivify *primary* heal extends the duration of Renewing Mist and Enveloping Mist on the target by 3 seconds. 

> 4pc has no synergy with Rising Mist but does have synergy with Mending Proliferation.

### Rising Mist

Rising Mists is back, and with it an entire rotation change from how we were playing in 10.2. A lot of newer Mistweavers have never played Rising Mist before so I’ll explain a bit about how it works and how to maximize its effectiveness. Smart Rising Mist play is essential.

When Rising Mist is talented, Rising Sun Kick / Rushing Wind Kick becomes one of the highest priority abilities in the kit because it extends our Renewing Mist and our Enveloping Mist. A lot of our talents rely on these two abilities in order to do their healing which means that whenever Rising Sun Kick / Rushing Wind Kick is off cooldown you need to press it. My biggest insider tip for making sure that you are pressing RSK off cooldown and playing the rotation well is to look at your cast timeline on logs and make sure that regardless of where you scroll on the timeline you will always be able to see RSK.

#### Cast Priority List
1. Vivify to keep someone alive who is in immediate danger and will die without your intervention
2. Revival/Restoral when it is needed or assigned
3. Renewing Mist if you are at 3 charges (2 without Pool of Mists)
4. Rising Sun Kick / Rushing Wind Kick
5. Thunder Focus Tea (Renewing Mist)
6. Enveloping Mist with a Strength proc
7. Vivify when it makes sense to heal someone
8. Tiger Palm if you have nothing else going on

### Incorporating Mana Tea
Mana Tea has gotten some buffs to compensate for the removal of Clouded Focus. These buffs make the mana restore portion of the ability significantly stronger than before which means we have a lot more mana to play around with. Your highest priority with Mana Tea is making sure you never miss out on stacks by sitting at 20 charges without using them. You need to find time to drink between your abilities and I recommend you “tap” Mana Tea before some of the more costly abilities to maximize the reduction portion of the ability. Anytime you want to press your Celestial you should tap Mana Tea. If you ever have a Strength proc and you wish to utilize it and you are outside of your Celestial you should tap Mana Tea before you cast that Enveloping Mist. If you know that you are going to be spamming Vivify soon because there is a major damage event then you should channel Mana Tea beforehand. 

Mana Tea also has an interaction with Misty Peaks which allows you to sometimes instantly cast Enveloping Mist during the channel of your Mana Tea. You can mess around with this a bit but the basic idea is that you get a proc of Misty Peaks then you channel Mana Tea then you press Enveloping Mist during the channel of Mana Tea and it should not cancel it. This can be useful for applying Enveloping Mist to someone who is taking a lot of damage or is about to be while you are still drinking Mana Tea. 

This is what tapping Mana Tea looks like:

Here we spend a single global cooldown channeling Mana Tea and then cancel our channel with another ability.

> TL;DR: If you are going to spend a lot of mana, channel mana tea beforehand.

### Celestial Rotation
During either Celestial, you will get a guaranteed proc of Strength of the Black Ox from your first Vivify or Tiger Palm cast. Keep this in mind especially when you are playing Gift of the Celestials.

**Jade Bond:** My best explanation for this one is to play it by ear as there is not a set rotation that will net you the most amount of HPS possible. Due to the duration of your Celestial with Jade Bond it becomes inefficient to spam Enveloping Mist repeatedly. To remedy this we want to improvise our rotation a bit depending on the needs of the raid at the time.

![Playing Jade Bond](.\images\PlayingJadeBond.jpg)

- Enveloping Mist: Should be pressed 3-4 times at the beginning of the Celestial and then used whenever there is impending damage or smaller ticking damage as a way to set up Renewing Mist, spread Enveloping Breaths, and to create Mending Proliferation buffs. This is not your primary form of healing during your Celestial so you should not be spamming Enveloping Mist repeatedly the entire time.
- Vivify: Your main healing ability during your Celestial to maximize your chance of proccing Courage as well as to extend your Enveloping Mist with your four set bonus. You should also have Zen Pulse procs either naturally or from Thunder Focus Tea that should be used when it makes sense. Vivify is your primary healing ability in your Celestial and your rotation in general and it gets a lot of value at this time because of the increased Renewing Mist count and the spread of the Enveloping Mist healing bonus. If there is suddenly a big burst of damage and you need to spam out healing to top the raid off quickly then you want to spam Vivify to do so.
- Renewing Mist: If you are about to cap at three stacks then you should press Renewing Mist. If you have Thunder Focus Tea up during your Celestial then you press TFT with Renewing Mist. 
- Rising Sun Kick / Rushing Wind Kick: Press on CD.
- Gift of the Celestials: Bread and butter that everyone has gotten used to over the course of Dragonflight. 
- Renewing Mist > Rising Sun Kick / Rushing Wind Kick > Mana Tea > Yu’lon > Enveloping Mist 3-4 times > Vivify ONCE > Enveloping Mist to consume the Strength proc > Vivify spam until RSK comes off CD > Vivify spam again  

> If you ever get another Strength of the Black Ox proc during your Vivify spam you can cast Enveloping Mist again to make sure not to overlap stacks.

### Outside of your Celestial

Following the priority spell list you should have a lot of free time between your Rising Sun Kick / Rushing Wind Kick and Renewing Mist casts which means that you can spam Vivify as much as your mana bar can take. Obviously, you are not wanting to spam Vivify when there is no damage but you should be aggressive with how often you are casting it. You are trying to play the role of a reactionary spot healer similar to how a Holy Paladin would play. You should also be paying attention to whom you have cast Enveloping Mist on or whoever has a Misty Peaks proc if you can react quickly enough. It is important that you track Enveloping Mist on players because you want to be casting Vivify onto these targets as much as possible because of our four set bonus and how it synergizes with the rest of our kit.  You also need to have a solid CPM on Vivify to ensure that you are getting enough CDR on your Celestial with Jade Bond (if you have it talented).

This is the ideal breakdown of casts that you are aiming for with this build. I know it looks extreme because Vivify is cast so often but this ensures that you are doing the most amount of HPS possible without sacrificing any other aspect of your rotation. 

Sheilun's Gift is going to be used as a strong heal whenever it makes the most sense to use it. It should not be something that is actively played around but more so as a better Vivify when it reaches high stacks. When you consume enough stacks you will proc your Heart of the Jade Serpent and without Unity Within this is not really that impactful so I do not really recommend even tracking it. 

During downtime where there is no healing to be done you can simply just DPS while keeping up with your Renewing Mist and Rising Sun Kick / Rushing Wind Kick casts however, you should always be anticipating incoming damage and be planning your GCDs accordingly.

### Celestial Conduit

This ability should be treated like a serious healing cooldown. It does a significant amount of your HPS overall and it can be paired with other healing cooldowns to effectively solo mechanics. It is important to keep in mind that following your Celestial Conduit you are going to gain a significant amount of CDR on your Renewing Mist, Rising Sun Kick / Rushing Wind Kick, Thunder Focus Tea, and Life Cocoon. All of these abilities should be utilized accordingly with the extra cooldown reduction.

### Stats

You can get pretty close to optimal by just strapping on your highest item level pieces with a lean toward Haste.

> Remember not to drop item level for secondaries. If you have a decent amount of haste then optimizing secondaries will do little for your performance.

### Rapidfire Questions
**How impactful is our tier set?**
- If you are playing around it and actively utilizing the extension portion of it then it is roughly a 5% HPS increase overall. 

**Can I still play Tear of Morning and Soothing Mist?**
- Definitely, although I do recommend you try out Rising Mist to see if you really enjoy it or not. I won’t be writing a guide for how to play around with Tear of Morning or Soothing Mist without Clouded Focus but you’re welcome to ask questions on them if you have any.

**Is mastery good now?**
- It’s improved significantly but not to the point where you’ll stack it.

**Why is there not a section on Master of Harmony?**
- It’s unplayable, buggy, undertuned, and unfun. They need to do a complete rework of the tree because it does nothing to alter the gameplay of the spec and feels horrible to use. 

**Why not Ancient Teachings?**
- The build is already really talent-starved and Ancient Teachings takes 5 points to do less than 10% of your HPS. It just isn’t good enough, even post-buffs. Mistweaver just does not really do a lot of DPS at the moment so Ancient Teachings is suffering hard.

**Is Mistweaver good?**
- Yeah Mistweaver is very good if you are skilled at the spec. It is a blast to play as always so I will be playing it as much as I can even in the Race to World First.

**Any plans for an M+ guide?**
- Not at this time. [Megasett](https://www.youtube.com/c/Megasett) makes very good Mythic+ YouTube content.
