# Season 1 Raids

Midnight Season 1 introduces three new raids - The Voidspire, The Dreamrift, and the March on Quel'Danas.

The following guides are designed around Heroic, with brief snippets at the bottom on Mythic mechanics.  The strategies within will work on Normal mode as well with reduced mechanics – it’s always good to practice good habits!

## Raid Information
There is no known Raid Renown track this time around.

The raids include 4 tiers of item level, increasing its starting base level as you progress.
- **Tier 1 (Early Boss):** (Imperator) all drop loot at 259 IL in heroic.
- **Tier 2 (Middle Bosses):** (Vorasius, Fallen-King, Chimaerus) all drop loot at 263 IL in heroic.
- **Tier 3 (Late Bosses):** (Vael & Ezz, Vanguard, Belo'ren) all drop loot at 266 IL in heroic.
- **Tier 4 (End Bosses):** (Crown, Midnight Falls) all drop loot at 269 IL in heroic.  End boss loot drops at a track one difficulty higher (so mythic track from heroic).

Below are some notable pieces of rare gear that drop at max IL on their upgrade track.
- **Ring:** Sin'dorei Band of Hope (Midnight Falls in March of Quel'Danas) - Taking shadow damage greater than 15% of your health grants a shield and avoidance.
- **Neck:** Eternal Voidsong Chain (Crown of the Cosmos in the Voidspire) - Dealing shadow damage has a chance to proc a DOT on the target.

**Voidspire:** 
- Vorasius *(Hands)*
- Fallen-King Salhadaar *(Shoulders)*
