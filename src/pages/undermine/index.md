# Liberation of Undermine

The Liberation of Undermine is a new eight boss raid. The raid opens on all three difficulties (Normal, Heroic, and Mythic) on March 4th (NA).

The following guides are designed around Heroic, with brief snippets at the bottom on Mythic mechanics.  The strategies within will work on Normal mode as well with reduced mechanics – it’s always good to practice good habits!

## Raid Information
There is a new Raid [Renown Track](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/raids/liberation-of-undermine/gallagio-loyalty-rewards-club) that will provide a variety of perks as your Renown increases.  
- You can Reputation by killing bosses each week on any difficulty, with a cap of 1 Renown per week.  
- There is a catch up mechanic for those unable to raid every week. 
- One of the biggest perks is a stacking 3% damage and healing buff that you receive on Week 4, 6, 10, 13, 16, and 19 (for a total of 18%).  This serves as a soft nerf of the raid as the season progresses.

The raid is linear. There are 4 tiers of item level within the raid, increasing in base item level as you progress.
