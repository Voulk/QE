# Nerub'ar Palace

Nerub’ar Palace is a new eight boss raid. Blizzard is back to releasing Normal and Heroic difficulty raids first on September 10th (NA). The following week will mark the opening of Mythic difficulty, on September 17th.

The following guides are designed around Heroic, with brief snippets at the bottom on Mythic mechanics.  The strategies within will work on normal mode as well with reduced mechanics – it’s always good to practice good habits!

## Useful information
There is a new instance buff called Severed Strands that increases your damage and healing done by 3% per stack. You gain this buff by exchanging a currency (Nerub-ar Finery) that is looted from raid bosses over time. This serves as a soft nerf of the raid as the season progresses.
The raid is linear. There are 4 tiers of item level within the raid, increasing in item level for every 2 bosses you kill.
- Ulgrax and The Bloodbound Horror
- Sikran and Rasha’nan
- Broodtwister Ovi’nax and Nexus-Princess Ky’veza
- Silken Court and Queen Ansurek

Very rare items are back and drop at the highest item level available for that track of gear.
