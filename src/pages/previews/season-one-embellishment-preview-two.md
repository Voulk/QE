# Midnight Embellishment Preview: Part II

Today we'll look at the other half of the embellishment effects. Between the two articles we'll have covered about 95% of the ones available. The remaining 5% are pure DPS embellishments. They could be useful in some niche cases like ultra high Mythic+ but we'll come back to those a bit later.

## The Difficulty with Sets

You'll notice that most of the embellishments in todays article are parts of sets where you need two pieces to activate the bonus. That introduces two problems:
- Cannot be put on weapons so if you craft a 2-handed weapon first you won't be able to craft the set for weeks.
- One piece of the bonus will use a spark but offer no bonus. So you're delaying your power boost longer. 
They can still be very good, but if they remain good expect not to see them until a little bit later in the season.
