# Manaforge Omega

The Manaforge Omega is a new eight boss raid. The raid opens on all three difficulties (Normal, Heroic, and Mythic) on August 12th (NA).

The following guides are designed around Heroic, with brief snippets at the bottom on Mythic mechanics.  The strategies within will work on Normal mode as well with reduced mechanics – it’s always good to practice good habits!

## Raid Information
There is a new Raid [Renown Track](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/raids/manaforge-omega/manaforge-vandals-renown) that will provide a variety of perks as your Renown increases.  
- You earn Reputation by killing bosses each week on any difficulty, with a cap of 1 Renown per week.  
- One of the biggest perks is a stacking 3% damage and healing buff that you receive on Week 4, 7, 10, 13, and 15 (for a total of 15%).  This serves as a soft nerf of the raid as the season progresses.

The raid includes 3 tiers of item level, increasing its starting base level as you progress.
- **Tier 1 (Bosses 1-3):** Plexus Sentinel, Loom'ithar, and Soulbinder Naazindhri all drop loot at 697 IL in heroic.
- **Tier 2 (Bosses 4-6):** Forgeweaver Araz, The Soul Hunters, and Fractillus all drop loot at 701 IL in heroic.
- **Tier 3 (Bosses 7-8):** Nexus-King Salhadaar and Dimensius all drop loot at 705 IL in heroic.

Notably while there are cantrip/unique items, there are no "Very Rare" drops this tier, so these items will not drop with the bonus item level of past rare items.
- **Boots (The Soul Hunters):** Increases the power of your Cloak, causing it to trigger 50% more frequently.
- **Ring (Dimensius):** Causes the power of your Cloak to also reduce Cosmic damage taken by 50% for 20 seconds or until a certain amount of damage has been absorbed.
- **Set Bonus -** Caster Trinket (Fractillus) and Weapon (Soulbinder for 2H Staff, Fractillus for dagger, or Nexus King for 1H Sword): The weapons will cause bonus damage or grant absorb shields, increased to be 200% more effective if paired with the Diamantine Voidcore trinket.
- **2H Agi/Strength Mace (Nexus-King):** Currently no known power gain, but han an on-use ability that auto loots and *crushes* nearby corpses, turning them into vendorable K'aresh Dust junk.

Five bosses drop Tier Tokens:
- Loom'thar *(Legs)*
- Soulbinder Naazindhri *(Hands)*
- Forgeweaver Araz *(Helm)*
- The Soul Hunters *(Shoulder)*
- Fractillus *(Chest)*
- Dimensius drops a Hungering Void Curio that can be exchanged for any of the 5 tier slots
