# Stats & Gearing

> Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished
>
> — Lao Tzu, grappling with his 14% Haste Resto Druid

## The Quick Answer?
You can get pretty close to optimal by just strapping on your highest item level pieces with a lean toward Haste.

### Raid & Healing Focused Mythic+
Intellect >>> Haste >> Mastery > Versatility >= Crit

### Damage Focused Mythic+
Intellect >>> Haste > Versatility = Crit > Mastery

Think of mastery as your most powerful mythic+ healing stat, and least powerful DPS stat, you can make a decision from there based on your playstyle. Gearing for item level is still a strong and sound strategy. This is also quite a difficult healing season so you might want to bring more healing than you have in the past.

:::tip[Notes on Stats]
Intellect is our most important stat. Gaining 1% more intellect will in general increase your healing by 1%.
Each secondary stat goes up in value the more you have of the other secondaries, which when combined with the strength of intellect makes just picking your highest ilvl gear particularly strong. **So long as you have reasonable Haste, your secondary allocation will never hold you back.**

## Ready to optimize?
![QE Live Intro](.\images\QELivePanel.png)

Run your gear through Questionably Epic Live. It has full support for stat diminishing returns, item and set effects, and how your current gear influences how much each stat is worth. It'll also let you pick between healing focused and damage focused Mythic+ profiles.



### Diminishing Returns
When you get to a certain amount of a stat you start getting a small penalty on any stats you accumulate above that. These are absolutely not stat caps, and Haste in particular is good enough that you'll happily continue to pick up pieces well past the first DR point. 
**If you're wondering if you have too much haste the answer is almost definitely no.** You can use QE Live above to double check. Diminishing returns applies to all stat rating which includes any trinket procs. It does not apply to percentage gains like Bloodlust, Lycara's Teachings or Mark of the Wild.

| Stat | First DR (-10%) | Second DR (-20%) | Third DR (-30%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Haste | 19800 | 26400 | 33000 |
| Mastery | 21000 | 28000 | 35000 |
| Crit | 21000 | 28000 | 35000 |
| Versatility | 23400 | 31200 | 39000 |

:::warning[Diminishing Returns]

You **really** don't have to think too much about diminishing returns on your gear. QE Live will take care of it for you, but as a Resto Druid you will also do well just gearing for priority stats without too much regard for how much you have of X.
