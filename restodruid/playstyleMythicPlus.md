# Mythic+

Healing as a Resto Druid in Mythic+ is somewhat similar as healing a raid except you have to take on the bulk of the spot healing yourself and the damage patterns are often burstier. You’ll need to run each dungeon a few times to get a good feeling for the damage patterns since, like raid, you'll want to set up for dangerous mechanics with HoTs. A basic grasp of your abilities is assumed so read through the Spells page if you're brand new to Resto Druid. Note that talents and stats have their own guide pages.

## Maintenance Healing
***Including most general pulls without notably dangerous mobs.***

- Lifebloom is one of your most important spells. During low damage pulls you can just keep one on the tank by default. As damage ramps up you can put one on yourself for handling group damage and put the other on an at-risk DPS. Uptime is extremely important since due to Photosynthesis (and Verdancy).
- Put Efflorescence down. Try and cover as many people as you can but make sure you hit the tank with it. There’s a real priority on being GCD efficient since the fewer you spend healing the more you can spend on damage. Efflorescence heals over a very long period of time and the Spring Blossoms HoTs give you some mastery value for if the group takes damage unexpectedly.
- Use Regrowth and Wild Growth to keep people healthy. Let your HoTs do most of the work. If they’re sitting on 80% health in Efflorescence then they’re fine. As with Efflorescence, Wild Growth is very GCD efficient. Remember that with Lifebloom out you’ll get more than one Regrowth HoT per cast via Rampant Growth.
- You’ll be able to focus a lot on damage on these packs.

We’ll discuss what to do as damage ramps up in the examples below but expect to use some of your big cooldowns for it. Flourish is your most powerful cooldown, Convoke the Spirits is ok – particularly if you’re caught without prep, and Tranquility is the weakest but also doesn’t require much prep.

You’ll notice here that you cast a lot of your spells in advance, before or as the damage hits. Getting used to this healing pattern is a key part of learning to play Druid well. Over time you’ll also practice healing in fewer, more efficient GCDs so that you have more time to DPS. You’ll generally alternate between the maintenance healing above and layering in more GCDs as required but it’s this strong base that allows us to do so much healing.

## Healing Scenarios - Short Burst Damage
Mythic+ contains a lot of short AoE bursts that you'll be responsible for as a healer. These can be some of the most dangerous mechanics because if you haven't prepared for them in advance you might be stuck when the damage hits. As a Resto Druid it's therefore important to know which mechanics are coming up. You do tend to learn this quite quickly after you've done each dungeon a few times. These mechanics tend to be on fixed timers so once you know them there will be no surprises. 

### Prep
Prepare the group for the AoE damage 5-6 seconds in advance. If you are new to a dungeon you can start even sooner. This trades efficiency for safety which is fine as a beginner.
- Make sure Efflorescence is down, and that you have 1-2 Lifeblooms out depending on build. 
- Put Rejuvenation on the group, prioritizing your DPS since AoE damage isn't often dangerous to your tank. 
- Cast Cenarion Ward on a DPS. It's often best to pick one that doesn't have Lifebloom but just having it out is most important.

### As damage hits
- Cast Wild Growth as the boss begins to cast. You'll also want to cast Grove Guardians here and you can drop 1-3 depending on how vulnerable you feel.
- With Lifebloom on DPS 1 and DPS 2, cast Swiftmend on DPS 3. This will heal them for a lot and give you the Soul of the Forest buff.
- Cast Regrowth to stablize the groups health.

## Healing Scenarios - Single Target DoTs
Sometimes you will get time to prepare for single target damage, and other times a random target will be chosen. Resto Druid is fairly good at either scenario but you will handle them slightly differently. If you're on a boss or pack that you know has dangerous single target DoTs then it is worth keeping Lifeblooms and Efflorescence out the entire time. 
- Cast Rejuvenation or Cenarion Ward on the target. 
- As damage starts to tick, cast Swiftmend then Regrowth. You can delay the Regrowth cast half a second to wait for the DoT to tick if necessary. 
- Follow up with further Regrowths.
