# Talents

Many talents have been changed slightly or reworked entirely coming into The War Within. We'll take a look at some of those, but first let's check out which build we'll be running.

## Key Talents

<FloatingImage title="Crane Style" paragraph="Crane Style is a hugely important talent that synergizes extremely well with the buffs to our mastery and to Jade Bond. It is essential for getting enough CDR to push Celestial with Jade Bond down to a 2 minute CD." image={require("./images/CraneStyle.jpg").default} />

&nbsp;

<FloatingImage title="Zen Pulse" paragraph="Zen Pulse has been reworked entirely from an active button to a passive effect that amplifies the healing that your Vivify and Invigorating Mists cleave does which is increased by the number of Renewing Mist you currently have active when pressing Vivify. Zen Pulse can stack up twice and it helps fix the square root scaling issue that Invigorating Mists has. The proc rate of this talent is extremely low on its own however, you can forcibly proc it using Thunder Focus Tea because of Deep Clarity. The Deep Clarity proc activates once you consume your Thunder Focus Tea buff." image={require("./images/ZenPulse.jpg").default} />

&nbsp;

<FloatingImage title="Chi Harmony" paragraph="Chi Harmony makes a return with a bit of a twist; it can no longer spread your Renewing Mist applied to the target for the duration of the Chi Harmony healing increase buff. This ends up being a blessing in disguise because it amplifies our spot healing by quite a bit. This talent shares a choice node with Lotus Infusion which is currently just weaker than Chi Harmony so it is not played." image={require("./images/ChiHarmony.jpg").default} />

&nbsp;

<FloatingImage title="Pool of Mists" paragraph="Pool of Mists makes a return from Warlords of Draenor. This talent helps to solve issues with RSK not resetting for Rising Mists making it a bit more consistent as well as adding more average Renewing Mist out through the CDR and the extra charge. It is a solid talent choice that took the spot of Clouded Focus on the choice node with Peer into Peace." image={require("./images/PoolOfMists.jpg").default} />

&nbsp;

<FloatingImage title="Jade Bond" paragraph="Jade Bond was buffed heavily which pushed it back into the spotlight for us if the right conditions are met. It is important to note that this guide is for those who want to min-max their gameplay as much as possible so the recommendation to play Jade Bond is under the assumption that you can get your Celestial down to a 2 minute cooldown. If you cannot get enough CDR to make your Celestial line up with 2 minute timers on a fight then it should not be played. Is it a major loss not playing Jade Bond? No, not really but it is still a loss if you do end up playing Gift when compared to min-maxed Jade Bond. TLDR: If you cannot hit a 2 minute Celestial then I recommend just playing Gift." image={require("./images/JadeBond.jpg").default} />

&nbsp;

<FloatingImage title="Mending Proliferation" paragraph="Previously an unused talent has suddenly become very good due to a number of factors. This will be expanded on when talking about our tierset later." image={require("./images/MendingProliferation.jpg").default} />

&nbsp;

<FloatingImage title="Rising Mist" paragraph="Welcome back the Lebron James of Mistweaver talents." image={require("./images/RisingMist.jpg").default} />

&nbsp;

<FloatingImage title="Rushing Wind Kick" paragraph="Rushing Wind Kick is a new talent that was added in 11.0.5 which replaces Rising Sun Kick with a ranged alternative that does significantly more damage and provides a buff to your Renewing Mist which increases the healing it does by 100% for 4 seconds. This talent interacts with all things that Rising Sun Kick would interact with and it will proc Rising Mists and Rapid Diffusion whether you hit a target or not." image={require("./images/Rushing-Wind-Kick.jpg").default} />

### Honorable Mentions

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Shaohao's Lesson" label="Shaohao's Lesson" default>
Shaohao’s Lessons fell behind comparatively to the other competitive talents so for now it remains unplayed. You still want to talent into Sheilun's Gift to utilize the CDR component of CotC through Heart of the Jade Serpent. You would just use Sheilun's Gift as a normal heal.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Misty Peaks">
Misty Peaks was changed to extend existing Enveloping Mist by 2 seconds. This has really good synergy with our tierset and with Mending Proliferation.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Lifecycles">
Lifecycles has perfect synergy with the playstyle of this build. It allows for a lot of extra Mana Tea stacks to be generated.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Invoker's Delight" >
Invoker’s Delight has caught a nerf coming into The War Within but is still a mandatory talent for this build. The haste granted has gone from 33% to 20% but as said before it is still extremely good.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Uplifted Spirits">
Uplifted Spirits (optional) replaces Dancing Mists if the fight has good timers for a 2 minute Revival and if you get enough CDR to push Revival to sub 2 minutes. Not in the default build.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Healing Elixir" default>
Healing Elixir got a bit of a change and is something that you can take if you feel like you really need the healing however, I do not recommend you play it just because Mistweaver is already extremely tanky as is. If you were to end up playing this I would recommend dropping Dancing Mists for it, if you have already dropped Dancing Mists then you can drop Chrysalis.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Tear of Morning">
Tear of Morning was nerfed quite a bit by the removal of Clouded Focus as well as the direct nerfs it received to forcibly push it out of the meta. It can be played but I do not recommend you play it if you wish to do the max amount of HPS.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Soothing Mist / Peer into Peace">
This is going to be contradictory to what I have said before but technically this playstyle is the highest HPS due to how much extra mana we have and how strong Soothing Mist is. However, the issue with this playstyle is that it is extremely unforgiving with forced movement mechanics which this upcoming raid has a lot of. I would recommend that you do not play these talents but if you do end up doing it you can DM me directly on Discord or ask me on my stream about minmaxing this playstyle.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Chi-ji + Ancient Teachings + Faeline Stomp" >
This playstyle is fun and with the buffs to mastery it can definitely be good for normal/heroic clears if you want to turn your brain off but it is not competitive in mythic with other builds unfortunately. Ancient Teachings appears tuned around Mythic+ which leaves it on the weak side for raid.
