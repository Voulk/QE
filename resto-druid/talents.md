# Talents & Builds

## Raid Build

### Raid Talent Choices

#### Convoke the Spirits vs Tree of Life

This is a close, competitive choice and for most fights you can play whichever you prefer. Tree of Life is very good against longer form damage phases or phases where you need to heal and move a lot at the same time. Convoke the Spirits offers a sharper alternative. You'll combine every Convoke with Flourish and every second Tree of Life with Flourish.

#### Regenerative Heartwood vs Unstoppable Growth

You might assume that Unstoppable Growth is locked in but while we love Wild Growth, the talent is an incredibly small increase to it (about 5% per point). Instead, we'll take Regenerative Heartwood which lets us make one ally basically immortal on a short cooldown. This also tends to add more HPS and in a better way.

## Mythic+ Build

In Mythic+ you have a ridiculous amount of choice over how you design your build. You can lean into Rejuvenation, which is an easy playstyle that should come naturally to raiders and newer players. Or, you can run a more traditional Lifebloom heavy build that's more GCD efficient, but requires an experienced pilot. For most I'd recommend the former but both see heavy play in higher keys. 

> While we'll call these the "Rejuv" and "Lifebloom" builds, both spells are still used in both builds.

    The Mythic+ Rejuvenation build (sometimes called LTB) is a fantastic choice for beginners since it lets you pour more healing into a given event at an efficiency cost which is rarely a negative when starting out. It also relies less on smart Lifebloom positioning and uptime though you'll still want to focus on that.

    The Lifebloom build is a more traditional Resto Druid build. It heals incredibly efficiently though requires strong lifebloom uptime and is slightly more difficult to play.

### Mythic+ Talent Choices
#### Liveliness vs Master Shapeshifter

Liveliness adds more damage than Master Shapeshifter - especially as Wildstalker. Master Shapeshifters niche is sustaining your mana so you never have to drink. Personally I think it's better to have to drink occasionally than lose DPS but the option is there.

#### Power of the Archdruid vs Undergrowth

The Rejuvenation build also has the option to forgo having two lifeblooms entirely by talenting into Power of the Archdruid instead. Whether a beginner or doing weekly keys it can be quite freeing to not have to worry about the uptime on three different buffs for most of the dungeon and Power of the Archdruid adds decent healing *on average*. The downside to the build is that it relies on chance, and when played well Lifebloom is one of your most powerful spells. High keys are often about being able to consistently bring a specific minimum amount of healing and relying on a proc isn't great for that. 

### <HeroTreeHeader heroTree="Wildstalker" /> vs <HeroTreeHeader heroTree="Keeper of the Grove" />
It's quite common for a spec to have a "good" Hero tree and a "bad" one but this isn't the case for Resto Druid. Both trees have unique advantages, including but not exclusively limited to:
- <HeroTreeHeader heroTree="Wildstalker" />: Superb single target healing via Implant and Vigorous Creepers, strong one minute burst healing with Convoke the Spirits (+ Implant), high DPS, quite passive.
- <HeroTreeHeader heroTree="Keeper of the Grove" />: Extra defensive power in Protective Growth, excellent control over your burst healing.

Now, I think the Wildstalker advantages are easier to take advantage of and I'd recommend you start with it. The tree has no real weaknesses and has great coverage for different damage patterns. A lot of the Keeper of the Grove advantages aren't relevant until title level keys and are dungeon specific.

> **I don't plan on using Cat Form much, should I still go Wildstalker?** Yeah, avoid thinking of Wildstalker as a Catweaving exclusive tree. We're primarily picking it for its excellent healing value - any DPS you get is an added bonus.


### Quickfire Questions
- **Do I have to DPS in Cat Form or "Catweave"?** You can get fairly far by not DPSing at all, but you will time more keys if you contribute damage and Cat Form is the best way to do that. You will find each dungeon has quite a few packs with little to heal and you can take advantage of those to add significant damage. 
- **Is it true that HoTs like Rejuvenation are only useful for the mastery value they bring?** No, they also heal for a lot on their own.
