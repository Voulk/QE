# Stats & Gearing

> Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished
>
> â€” Lao Tzu, grappling with his 14% Haste Resto Druid

## The Quick Answer?


<SideBySideFlex
  leftTitle="Raid & Healing Focused Mythic+"
  leftText="Intellect >>> Haste >> Mastery > Versatility > Crit"
  rightTitle="Damage Focused Mythic+"
  rightText="Intellect >>> Haste > Versatility = Crit > Mastery"
/>


#### Mastery??
Think of mastery as your most powerful mythic+ healing stat, and least powerful DPS stat, you can make a decision from there based on your playstyle. Gearing for item level is still a strong and sound strategy. This is also quite a difficult healing season so you might want to bring more healing than you have in the past.

:::tip[Why Item Level is so good]
Intellect is our most important stat. Gaining 1% more intellect will in general increase your healing by about 1%.
Each secondary stat goes up in value the more you have of the other secondaries, which when combined with the strength of intellect makes just picking your highest ilvl gear particularly strong. **So long as you have reasonable Haste, your secondary allocation will never hold you back.**

## Extras

### Reagents
- **Flask:** <span style={{color: '#B59D36'}}>[Flask of Tempered Swiftness](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=431972)</span>
- **Weapon Rune:** <ITEM>Algari Mana Oil</ITEM>
- **Food:** <ITEM>Feast</ITEM>
- **Augment Rune:** <ITEM>Crystallized Augment Rune</ITEM> - Note that <ITEM>Dreambound Augment Rune</ITEM> from Dragonflight also still works for a very small but free int bonus.
- **Potion:** <ITEM>Algari Mana Potion</ITEM> / <ITEM>Tempered Potion</ITEM>. Note that any potion that requires you sit and drink for 10 seconds is much worse now due to Master Shapeshifter.

### Enchants
- **Weapon:** <ITEM>Fiery Resolve</ITEM> / <ITEM>Radiant Power</ITEM>
- **Cloak:** <ITEM>Chant of Leeching Fangs</ITEM>
- **Chest:** <ITEM>Crystalline Radiance</ITEM>
- **Bracers:** <ITEM>Chant of Armored Leech</ITEM>
- **Legs:** <ITEM>Sunset Spellthread</ITEM>
- **Boots:** <ITEM>Defender's March</ITEM>
- **Ring:** <ITEM>Radiant Haste</ITEM>

### Gems
- First Gem Slot: 1x <ITEM>Elusive Blasphemite</ITEM>
- 1x <ITEM>Quick Onyx</ITEM>
- 1x <ITEM>Quick Sapphire</ITEM>
- <ITEM>Masterful Emerald</ITEM> in all other slots.

The thought process here is to wear one of a few different types of gems to maximize the value of our meta gem, <ITEM>Elusive Blasphemite</ITEM>. Gem value is quite low this expansion so there's minimal loss in trading a few Haste + Mastery gems to get some extra movement speed. Fill your remaining slots with <ITEM>Masterful Emerald</ITEM>.

## Cyrce's Circlet
<ITEM>Cyrce's Circlet</ITEM> is a special effect ring that drops from the [Siren Isle](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/the-war-within/patch-11-0-7-cyrces-circlet-customizable-ring) content. You'll wear it in season 2 until its inevitable nerf. Here are the recommended gems:
- **Thunder:** <ITEM>Stormbringer's Runed Citrine</ITEM>
- **Sea:** <ITEM>Fathomdweller's Runed Citrine</ITEM>
- **Wind:** <ITEM>Legendary Skipper's Citrine</ITEM>

You can trade overall raid value for some minor HPS by slotting <ITEM>Old Salt's Bardic Citrine</ITEM>.

## Diminishing Returns
When you get to a certain amount of a stat you start getting a small penalty on any stats you accumulate above that. These are absolutely not stat caps, and Haste in particular is good enough that you'll happily continue to pick up pieces well past the first DR point. 
**If you're wondering if you have too much haste the answer is almost definitely no.** You can use QE Live above to double check. Diminishing returns applies to all stat rating which includes any trinket procs. It does not apply to percentage gains like Bloodlust, Lycara's Teachings or Mark of the Wild.

| Stat | First DR (-10%) | Second DR (-20%) | Third DR (-30%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Haste | 19800 | 26400 | 33000 |
| Mastery | 21000 | 28000 | 35000 |
| Crit | 21000 | 28000 | 35000 |
| Versatility | 23400 | 31200 | 39000 |

:::warning[Diminishing Returns]

You **really** don't have to think too much about diminishing returns on your gear. QE Live will take care of it for you, but as a Resto Druid you will also do well just gearing for priority stats without too much regard for how much you have of X.
