# Updating your UI

## Addons
You can succeed as a healer with a wide range of different user interfaces. These addons are most important:
- Proper raid frames (Grid2, Danders updated for Prepatch - Cell / ElvUI / Possibly Vuhdo coming soon)
- Weak Auras
- Boss Addon (Bigwigs preferred but DBM is acceptable)

### Grid2
![Grid2 Profile](.\images\Grid2Midnight.png)

**Why you want it:**
- Better Customization than default frames.
- It’s easy on your CPU and uses hardly any memory.
- Can be combined with macros or Clique for mouse-over casting (recommend Clique).

## Weak Auras
WeakAuras are no longer available in Midnight


## Useful Macros
| Purpose | Macro |
| --- | --- |
| Self Cast Innervate | /cast [@player] Innervate |
| Mouseover Casts. Replace Rejuvenation with whatever spell name you'd like | /cast [@mouseover,help] Rejuvenation; Rejuvenation |
| Travel Cat: This attempts to put you into Travel Form, but will pick Cat Form instead if you're inside. | #showtooltip <br /> /cast [indoors] Cat Form; Travel Form(Shapeshift)

While Mouseover healing is essential, I'd recommend using an addon like Clique or Clicked instead of macros since it's much faster.
