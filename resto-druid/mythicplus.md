# Mythic+

Healing as a Resto Druid in Mythic+ is somewhat similar as healing a raid except you have to take on the bulk of the spot healing yourself and the damage patterns are often burstier. You’ll need to run each dungeon a few times to get a good feeling for the damage patterns since, like raid, you'll want to set up for dangerous mechanics with HoTs. A basic grasp of your abilities is assumed so read through the Spells page if you're brand new to Resto Druid. Note that talents and stats have their own guide pages.

## Maintenance Healing
***Including most general pulls without notably dangerous mobs.***

![Maintenance Example](.\images\Druid-Maintenance.png)
- <WH>Lifebloom</WH> is one of your most important spells. During low damage pulls you can just keep one on the tank by default. As damage ramps up put both on players that will take a lot of damage - often two DPS players. Uptime is extremely important due to <WH>Photosynthesis</WH> (and to a lesser degree <WH>Verdancy</WH>).
- Put <WH>Efflorescence</WH> down. Try and cover as many people as you can. There’s a real priority on being GCD efficient since the fewer you spend healing the more you can spend on damage. <WH>Efflorescence</WH> heals over a very long period of time and the <WH>Spring Blossoms</WH> HoTs give you valuable mastery value.
- Use <WH>Regrowth</WH> and <WH>Wild Growth</WH> to keep people healthy. Let your HoTs do most of the work. If they’re sitting on 80% health in <WH>Efflorescence</WH> then they’re fine. Both <WH>Efflorescence</WH> and <WH>Wild Growth</WH> are very GCD efficient. Remember that with <WH>Lifebloom</WH> out you’ll get more than one <WH>Regrowth</WH> HoT per cast via <WH>Rampant Growth</WH>.
- You’ll be able to focus a lot on damage on these packs.


You'll have noticed that Resto Druid has a real expectation of knowing what damage is coming in advance so that you can prep for it. Getting used to this healing pattern is a key part of learning to play Druid well. Over time you’ll also practice healing in fewer, more efficient GCDs so that you have more time to DPS. You’ll generally alternate between the maintenance healing above and layering in more GCDs as required but it’s this strong base that allows us to do so much healing.

## Healing Scenarios - Short Burst Damage
Mythic+ contains a lot of short AoE bursts that you'll be responsible for as a healer. These can be some of the most dangerous mechanics because if you haven't prepared for them in advance you might be stuck when the damage hits. These mechanics tend to be on fixed timers so once you know them there will be no surprises. 

### Prep
Prepare the group for the AoE damage 3-6 seconds in advance. If you are new to a dungeon you can start even sooner. Trading efficiency for safety is fine as a beginner.
- Make sure <WH>Efflorescence</WH> is down, and that you have 1-2 <WH>Lifebloom</WH>s out depending on build. 
- Put <WH>Rejuvenation</WH> on the group, prioritizing your DPS since AoE damage isn't often dangerous to your tank. 
- Cast <WH>Cenarion Ward</WH> on a DPS. It's often best to pick one that doesn't have <WH>Lifebloom</WH> but just having it out is most important.

### As damage hits
- Cast <WH>Wild Growth</WH> right before or as the boss begins to cast. You'll also want to cast <WH>Grove Guardians</WH> here and you can drop 1-3 depending on how vulnerable you feel.
- With <WH>Lifebloom</WH> on DPS 1 and DPS 2, cast <WH>Swiftmend</WH> on DPS 3. This will heal them for a lot and give you the <WH>Soul of the Forest</WH> buff.
- Cast <WH>Regrowth</WH> to stablize the groups health.

### AoE Healing Example
*[Full video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVVfzDG3tEM)*
<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', alignItems: 'flex-start' }}>
  <ReactPlayer 
    url="https://i.imgur.com/UkGOTmF.mp4"

    style={{ paddingRight: "12px" }} 
    width="500px"
    height="auto"
  />
<div style={{ flex: '1', minWidth: '200px' }}>
    Note the preparation here. Big damage is coming up and so two lifeblooms are out and <WH>Efflorescence</WH> is down. Damage is further prepped for by casting <WH>Regrowth</WH> to put out three HoTs (via <WH>Rampant Growth</WH>). <WH>Convoke the Spirits</WH> is sufficient for the Shadow Decay. If <WH>Convoke the Spirits</WH> isn't up you can cast more <WH>Rejuvenation</WH> before the mechanic.

## Healing Scenarios - Single Target DoTs
Sometimes you will get time to prepare for single target damage, and other times a random target will be chosen. Resto Druid is fairly good at either scenario but you will handle them slightly differently. If you're on a boss or pack that you know has dangerous single target DoTs then it is worth keeping <WH>Lifebloom</WH>s and <WH>Efflorescence</WH> out the entire time. 
- Cast <WH>Rejuvenation</WH> or <WH>Cenarion Ward</WH> on the target. 
- As damage starts to tick, cast <WH>Swiftmend</WH> then <WH>Regrowth</WH>. You can delay the <WH>Regrowth</WH> cast half a second to wait for the DoT to tick if necessary. 
- Follow up with further <WH>Regrowth</WH>s.
