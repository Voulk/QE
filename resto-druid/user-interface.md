# Updating your UI

## Addons
You can succeed as a healer with a wide range of different user interfaces. These addons are most important:
- Proper raid frames (Grid2, Danders updated for Prepatch - Cell / ElvUI / Possibly Vuhdo coming soon)
- Weak Auras
- Boss Addon (Bigwigs preferred but DBM is acceptable)

### Grid2 Raid Frames
**Curseforge Link:** [Link](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/grid2)

![Grid2 Profile](.\images\Grid2Midnight.png)

**Why you want it:**
- Better Customization than default frames.
- It’s easy on your CPU and uses hardly any memory.
- Can be combined with macros or Clique for mouse-over casting (recommend Clique).

***There are still some bugs with Grid2 right now but they should be fixed shortly.***

### Danders Raid Frames
**Curseforge Link:** [Link](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/danders-frames)

![Danders Profile](.\images\DandersFrames-Midnight.png)

**Why you want it:**
- Better Customization than default frames.
- Works quite well out of the box.


***There are some performance issues with Danders right now but they should be fixed shortly.***

## Weak Auras
WeakAuras are no longer available in Midnight.


## Useful Macros
| Purpose | Macro |
| --- | --- |
| Self Cast Innervate | /cast [@player] Innervate |
| Mouseover Casts. Replace Rejuvenation with whatever spell name you'd like | /cast [@mouseover,help] Rejuvenation; Rejuvenation |
| Travel Cat: This attempts to put you into Travel Form, but will pick Cat Form instead if you're inside. | #showtooltip <br /> /cast [indoors] Cat Form; Travel Form(Shapeshift)

While Mouseover healing is essential, I'd recommend using an addon like Clique or Clicked instead of macros since it's much faster.
